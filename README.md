# Project Name
React Gallery

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
1.At first nothing was rendering to dom even though I was calling my get function in my useEffect. Problem occurred because I accidentally placed my use effect in get function so It was not working properly.
2.Double rendering issue: my images were double rendering because I had image src on my conditional rendering and also hard coded after 
3.Could not target the images right away because I put the classname in gallerylist since I was passing it to galleryItem however that was not the right approach i had to give classname to exact component i was rendering
